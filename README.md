# Fine Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow.
This is a guided project from coursera on fine-tuning a Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (BERT) model for text classification with TensorFlow. it contains preprocess and tokenize data for BERT classification, build TensorFlow input pipelines for text data with the tf.data API, and train and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification with TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Hub.
